<h3>Why yet another plotter?</h3>
<p>Clearly, there are many data visualization tools available and
everyone probably has their own favorite. Yeah, GNUPlot is nice and
so is GLE, but one of the few plotters that starts up in a snap and lets
you browse data without hassle is XGraph. I needed a couple of
new features for XGraph (hence the name SGraph) to suite my
visualization needs, but it turned out too difficult to modify. So one
weekend I hacked up something similar using <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL</a> and C++. I haven't
used XGraph since, so it was worth the trouble. 
</p>
</div> 

<div id="blah"> <h3>Features</h3>
<p>
Many of the features are copied from XGraph, there is even visual
similarity. Still, the focus is slightly more on painless interactive
plotting and not so much about print quality results. </p>

<p>
The plotter can also be used for real-time plotting, which means that it can
periodically update the plot if the datafiles have changed. This is
useful e.g. for following the state of MCMC integration. Also, it is
possible to tail a file.

<div id="blah"> <h3>The code</h3>
<p>
The code is written with portability and extensibility in mind. The work is of
course not completely finished, but then again what is ever
finished? I already use it on a daily basis and it works. Doxygen
documentation of the code can be found <a href="./html/index.html">here</a>.
